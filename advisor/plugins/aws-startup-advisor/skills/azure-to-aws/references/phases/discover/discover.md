# Phase 1: Discover Azure Resources

## Orientation

Inventory what exists on Azure into `azure-resource-inventory.json` in
`$MIGRATION_DIR/`, and derive `azure-resource-clusters.json` from it. This phase is
composed of FRAGMENTS (independent discoverers) plus one ASSEMBLER, declared in the
frontmatter `_fragments`/`_assemble` — the interpreter runs each fragment whose
`_trigger` is true (loading its `_file` only then), then the assembler. Read each
unit file for its own contract; this phase owns only lifecycle and the cross-cutting
`_postconditions`.

Two facts the frontmatter cannot express:

1. **Fragments are additive, not redundant, and they may disagree.** IaC carries
   *declared intent* (module structure, naming, what is parameterized, and resources
   declared but never deployed). Live `az` and RDfA carry *actual state*. When two
   sources disagree about the same `azure_id`, the assembler records BOTH values and
   which one won as a drift entry. A disagreement is never silently reconciled — the
   drift is itself customer-visible value.

2. **The canonical type vocabulary is ARM, not Terraform.** Four of the five
   discovery sources speak `Microsoft.*` natively; only Terraform needs translating.
   That translation happens inside `discover-iac.md`, so every downstream table
   keys off one vocabulary. `azure_id` is the full ARM resource ID, which embeds
   subscription and resource group — one field supplies the cluster seed key, the
   environment scope, and uniqueness with no derivation.

## Status — build steps 2 and 4 (partial)

Terraform discovery is real and clustering is real. One fragment (`discover-iac.md`,
Terraform only) plus an assembler that writes both artifacts.

| Lands in | What                                                                                   |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| step 2   | Bicep + ARM inside `discover-iac.md`; the `billing` and `app-code` fragments           |
| step 2   | The `rdfa` fragment, then the live `az` path — security contract, capture pre-work, parsing fragment, in that order |
| step 4   | `patterns.md` — pattern RECOGNITION only. Seed / split / merge / tier / primary / roles are implemented in `references/clustering/`; every cluster carries `pattern_status: "catalog_absent"` until the catalog exists |

The live `az` path will NOT be a plain fragment. This phase runs under
`_exec: { _agent: rw }` with `_interactive: false`, and a dispatched worker is
file-only — it cannot prompt for consent. Live capture therefore becomes
main-window pre-work invoked from this phase's `_preconditions` prose, writing to
`$MIGRATION_DIR/live-capture/`, with the dispatched fragment merely parsing that
directory. RDfA needs no such split: reading an archive the customer already handed
over is not interactive.

## Step: Run the phase

1. Perform `_init` state setup per `INTERPRETER.md` § `_init: true`.
2. Run each fragment whose `_trigger` holds.
3. Run `discover-assemble.md`.
4. Evaluate `_postconditions`. On all-pass emit `HANDOFF_OK`; on any failure emit
   `GATE_FAIL` and stop. Do not patch an artifact to force a gate to pass.
