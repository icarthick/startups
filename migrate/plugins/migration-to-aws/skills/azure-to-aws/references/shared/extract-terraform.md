# Extraction rules — Terraform (`azurerm_*`)

Loaded by `discover-iac.md` only when `.tf` files containing `azurerm_*` resources are
present. One of three per-dialect refs; the others are `extract-bicep.md` and
`extract-arm.md`. Each covers surface syntax only — the artifact contract is
`schema-discover-azure.md` and the canonical type vocabulary is
`arm-type-canonicalization.md`.

## Step 1: Find the files

Glob `**/*.tf` and `**/*.tf.json`, excluding `**/node_modules/` and any path under
`$MIGRATION_DIR`. Exclude `.terraform/` too on this first pass — its `modules/`
subtree is walked deliberately in Step 3, per module, so that each module's resources
carry the right `config.tf_module` provenance rather than appearing as loose root
resources. Read each file. A `.tf` file with no `azurerm_` or
`azapi_` resource block contributes nothing and is not an error — many repos carry
provider, backend, and variable files with no resources at all.

**Do not read `terraform.tfstate`, `*.tfstate.backup`, or any `*.tfstate`.** State files
contain resolved attribute values including secrets that the configuration only
references. They are a credential-disclosure surface, and the declared configuration
is what this fragment is for. If a state file is the only thing present, say so and
recommend a live `az` capture instead — state is not a supported input.

**One exception inside `.terraform/`: `.terraform/modules/` IS read** — it holds
downloaded module source and nothing else, so it is exactly as safe as a local module
path. See Step 3, which explains why the blanket ban was over-broad and what it cost.
Everything else under `.terraform/` stays out of scope.

## Step 2: Extract each `resource` block

For every `resource "azurerm_<x>" "<local_name>" { … }`:

1. **Translate the type** via `arm-type-canonicalization.md`. A type absent from that
   table is recorded in `warnings[]` as `untranslated_terraform_type` with the local
   name, and the resource is skipped. **Never guess an ARM type from the Terraform
   name** — a wrong type does not fail loudly, it silently fails to match every
   mapping table and the resource falls through the unknown-type policy for the wrong
   reason.
2. **Resolve `name`** from the block's `name` attribute. When it is an expression
   (`"${var.prefix}-app"`, a `format()` call, a `random_*` reference), record the
   expression verbatim in `config.name_expression` and set `name` to the Terraform
   local name prefixed `tf:` (e.g. `tf:api`). Do not attempt to evaluate it. A guessed
   name breaks the drift comparison against a live capture. Add a
   `name_expression_unresolved` warning: the reconstructed `azure_id` then carries a
   `tf:` segment and is **not** a real ARM resource ID, so that resource cannot be
   matched against a live capture — and nothing else in the artifact says so.
3. **Resolve `resource_group_name`.** If it is a reference
   (`azurerm_resource_group.app.name`), follow it to that block's `name`. If that is
   itself an expression, apply rule 2.

   **A CHILD resource inherits its parent's resource group.** Many child types carry no
   `resource_group_name` at all and instead reference the parent
   (`storage_account_id`, `server_id`, `namespace_name`, `virtual_network_name`):
   follow that reference and take the parent's group. Treating an absent
   `resource_group_name` as unresolvable would null out the group for storage shares
   and containers, SQL databases, Event Hubs, Service Bus queues and topics, and Cosmos
   databases — most of a real estate's child resources — and a resource with no group
   cannot be clustered, so the whole cluster seed would collapse.

   Only when neither an explicit group nor a resolvable parent exists: set
   `resource_group: null` and add a `resource_group_unresolved` warning.
4. **Resolve `location`** the same way, into `location`.
5. **Reconstruct `azure_id`** per `arm-type-canonicalization.md` § Reconstructing
   `azure_id`, including the resource-group exception, the implicit-singleton segment
   for storage sub-services, and the `<subscription-unknown>` placeholder rule. When
   the placeholder is used, add ONE `subscription_id_unresolved` warning for the run —
   not one per resource — and set `iac_metadata.subscription_id_source: "unresolved"`.
6. **Set `source: "terraform"`** and record provenance in `config.tf_file`,
   `config.tf_resource_name`, and `config.tf_address`. Provenance is the reason IaC
   stays a first-class source even where live capture is authoritative for state: it
   is what lets Generate emit replacement Terraform that resembles what the customer
   already maintains.

   **`config.tf_address` is `<azurerm_type>.<local_name>`** (e.g.
   `azurerm_subnet.data`), and it is the identity field — `tf_resource_name` alone is
   NOT unique. Terraform namespaces local names per type, so a single module routinely
   contains `azurerm_resource_group.data` and `azurerm_subnet.data`, or
   `azurerm_linux_web_app.storefront` and `azurerm_application_insights.storefront`.
   Anything keyed on the bare local name silently collapses those pairs into one.
7. **Copy the sizing and routing attributes** the mapping tables need — see § Per-type
   attributes.
8. **Extract edges** — see § Edges.

Count `count` and `for_each` as **one** inventory entry, with
`config.multiplicity_expression` set to the expression,
`config.multiplicity_resolved: false`, and a `multiplicity_unresolved` warning. Do not
fan out into N entries: the count is usually a variable, so fanning out invents
resources. Flag it, because a `for_each` over a map of five apps is exactly the case
where the estimate is otherwise five times wrong in the other direction.

## Step 2a: `azapi_resource` states its ARM type outright

The AzAPI provider (`Azure/azapi`) addresses the ARM REST API directly, and a real repo
reaches for it whenever the `azurerm` provider lags an API version or a resource has no
`azurerm` implementation at all. It is common in modern Azure Terraform and must not be
skipped.

```hcl
resource "azapi_resource" "orders_budget" {
  type      = "Microsoft.Consumption/budgets@2023-05-01"
  name      = "orders-monthly"
  parent_id = azurerm_resource_group.platform.id
  body      = { properties = { amount = 2500 } }
}
```

**This is the easiest extraction in the file, and the reason is worth stating: `type`
already carries the canonical ARM type.** No canonicalization lookup is needed and none
must be attempted.

1. **Split `type` on `@`.** The left half is `azure_type` verbatim —
   `Microsoft.Consumption/budgets`. The right half is the ARM API version; keep it in
   `config.azapi_api_version`, because it is the only place a reader can see which API
   surface the customer targeted.
2. **`azure_type` is used AS GIVEN.** Do not look it up in
   `arm-type-canonicalization.md`, do not normalise it toward a row in that table, and do
   not record it as an untranslated type. The table exists to translate `azurerm_*` names;
   an AzAPI resource has already skipped that problem. Casing folds on comparison per that
   file's § Casing is a convention, not a fact, so a `type` whose casing differs from the
   table's spelling is still the same type.
3. **`parent_id` is the containment parent**, so `azure_id` is
   `<parent_id>/<type-last-segment>/<name>`. Containment is derivable by truncation and is
   **not** an edge (13.3f). When `parent_id` is an unresolved reference, apply the same
   `<subscription-unknown>` rule as everywhere else.
4. **Read `body` for routing attributes only, and never for values.** `body` is an
   arbitrary ARM payload, so it can contain anything — including secrets. Extract only the
   attributes the § Per-type attributes table names for that ARM type; if the type has no
   row there, extract `sku`, `tier` and `capacity` if present and nothing else. The secret
   boundary in § Secrets applies to `body` in full.
5. **Set `config.declared_via: "azapi"`.** Design needs it: an AzAPI resource is evidence
   the customer is already working around an `azurerm` gap, which is a useful signal for
   the report, and it explains why the type may be absent from the canonicalization table
   while still being perfectly well identified.

**`azapi_update_resource` and `azapi_resource_action` emit no inventory entry.** They
mutate a resource declared elsewhere — the AzAPI analogue of the association-only class
(13.2d) — so they are not resources and are not untranslated types. Record nothing, warn
nothing.

**A cost-bearing AzAPI type with no disposition still STOPs Design**, exactly as any other
type would. Naming a resource is not the same as knowing what it maps to: the untranslated
STOP is about the *type vocabulary*, and the unknown-type policy (§ 7a.4) is about the
*disposition*. AzAPI clears the first and not the second.

## Step 3: Modules are boundaries, not resources

A `module` block is not a resource and gets no inventory entry. Resolve its source in
this order, and stop at the first that works:

1. **Local path** (`./modules/network`, `../shared`) — recurse into it and extract its
   resources, recording the module address in `config.tf_module`.
2. **Already downloaded** — a registry or git module that has been `terraform init`-ed
   is on disk under `.terraform/modules/<key>/`. **Read it.** Resolve the key via
   `.terraform/modules/modules.json`, which maps each module's `Key` and `Source` to its
   `Dir`. Recurse exactly as for a local path, and set `config.tf_module_source` to the
   registry address so the report can say where the resources came from.
3. **Not on disk** — add one `module_not_resolved` warning naming the module and stating
   that its resources were not discovered.

> exception in this file.** Step 1 bans `.terraform/` wholesale to keep state files out,

A silently missing module is a silently missing third of the estate, and it remains the
most common reason a Terraform-only inventory is incomplete — which is why
`iac_metadata.modules_unresolved` and the warning both name the module rather than
reporting a count.

## Per-type attributes

Only what a downstream table actually reads. Everything else stays out of `config`.

**Omit, do not null.** An attribute the configuration does not set is left OUT of
`config`. Writing `"zone_balancing_enabled": null` for every unset attribute in every
row below turns `config` into mostly noise, and it makes "the customer did not set this"
indistinguishable from "the extractor found nothing to read."

**A type with no row here still gets an entry** — `azure_id`, `azure_type`,
`resource_group`, `subscription_id`, `source`, and the `config.tf_*` provenance are
unconditional. A missing row means "no downstream table reads a sizing or routing
attribute from this type", never "skip the resource".

**If a type below is missing an attribute a mapping table needs, the row is the bug.**
The failure is silent and expensive: the extraction is correct by its own ref, the
inventory passes every shape assertion, and the attribute is simply absent when Design
or Estimate reaches for it. Four rows in this table (Key Vault, Log Analytics, private
endpoints, App Insights) were added after exactly that happened.

| Canonical type                              | Carry into `config`                                                        | Why                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `Microsoft.Web/serverfarms`                 | `sku_name`, `worker_count`, `os_type`, `zone_balancing_enabled`             | the plan is the compute unit and its SKU + instance count is what is being paid for |

| `Microsoft.Storage/.../blobServices/containers` | `container_access_type`                                                 | `blob` or `container` means public read, which becomes an S3 public-access-block decision |

## Secrets: names only, never values

**This is a hard boundary, and Terraform makes it easy to cross by accident.**

- `app_settings` and `connection_string` blocks: extract **keys only**, into
  `config.app_setting_names` as a sorted array of strings. Never the values.
- `azurerm_key_vault_secret`: inventory the resource, record its `name`, never its
  `value`.
- A literal-looking value anywhere (a connection string, an account key, a password,
  a token) is **discarded**, not recorded and not redacted-in-place — a redacted
  placeholder still tells a reader the field existed and how long it was.
- A `value` that is a Key Vault reference (`@Microsoft.KeyVault(...)`) is retained as
  an **edge** (`secret_ref`), not as a value: the reference is architecture, the
  secret is not.

The phase's postcondition asserts this against the produced artifact, so a slip is a
gate failure rather than a review finding.

## Edges

Terraform expresses relationships as interpolated references, so the edge set comes
from the reference graph rather than from resolved ARM IDs (which the source does not
contain). Resolve each reference to the target's reconstructed `azure_id`.

| Terraform attribute                                                | Edge `type`          | Notes                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `service_plan_id` / `app_service_plan_id` on a site                | `hosted_on`          | **The edge that prevents the 5× App Service Plan cost error.** Always extract it. |
| `subnet_id`, `virtual_network_subnet_id`                           | `network`            | VNet colocation                                                        |
| `private_service_connection.private_connection_resource_id` on a private endpoint | `private_link` | the app-to-data edge; see below                              |
| `@Microsoft.KeyVault(...)` in an app setting, or a `key_vault_id`   | `secret_ref`         | value is never recorded, only the reference                            |
| a reference to a data resource's `fqdn` / `hostname` / `endpoint` / `.id` from a compute resource's config | `data_ref` | **the app-to-data edge.** The commonest real form is an app setting interpolating a database or cache address. It is the edge that merges an app and its database when they sit in different resource groups, so dropping it defeats the merge |
| `principal_id` + `scope` on an `azurerm_role_assignment`           | `identity_grant`     | "app X reads storage Y" — cleaner than GCP exposes it                  |
| `tags` containing `app` or `workload`                              | `declared_affinity`  | declared intent when present; tag KEYS are safe to keep verbatim       |

Set `via` on each edge to the attribute name it came from, so the Clarify assumption
sheet can explain *why* two resources were called one workload.

**Private endpoints are edge-bearing config sources, not mapping targets.** Inventory
the endpoint (a resource absent from the inventory cannot be reported as skipped), but
also emit the `private_link` edge from the endpoint's *consumer* to the resource it
fronts, and add one `warnings[]` entry per consumed endpoint naming the edge it
produced. Structurally this is the same case as gcp's `*_app_version` resources.

**Cross-resource-group edges are the important ones.** An app in `rg-app` referencing
a database in `rg-data` is exactly the horizontal-resource-group layout that
resource-group-seeded clustering gets wrong on its own, so the edge is what later
merges them. Never drop an edge because it crosses a group boundary.

## Validation before returning

- [ ] Every site with a `service_plan_id` has a `hosted_on` edge.
- [ ] `config.app_setting_names` contains only strings; no `app_settings` values appear anywhere in the contribution.
- [ ] No `tfstate` file was read.
- [ ] Every `module` block resolved to a local path, to `.terraform/modules/`, or to a `module_not_resolved` warning — none silently ignored.
