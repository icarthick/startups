# Phase 4: Estimate AWS Costs

## Orientation

Calculate projected monthly AWS costs for the designed Azure-to-AWS architecture,
producing `estimation-infra.json` (conforming to
`references/vendored/estimate/estimation-infra.schema.json`) and classifying migration
complexity using the tier thresholds in `references/vendored/estimate/complexity-tiers.json`.

Composed of a cost-engine fragment + one assembler (declared in the frontmatter). The
fragment computes the financial picture using `references/vendored/pricing/aws-infra-pricing.json`
as the primary source and the `awspricing` MCP tool as secondary fallback. The assembler
writes the final artifact and presents the summary.

The `azure-pricing-cache.md` source-side baseline is available to show an optional
Azure-vs-AWS cost comparison if the user requests it.

## Scope Boundary

**This phase covers financial analysis ONLY.**

FORBIDDEN — Do NOT change architecture mappings from Phase 3, generate Terraform code,
present human labor costs, or present professional services fees.

**Your ONLY job: Show the financial picture of moving from Azure to AWS. Nothing else.**
