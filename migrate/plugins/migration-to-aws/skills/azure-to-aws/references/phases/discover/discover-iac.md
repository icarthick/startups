# Discover — Infrastructure as Code

> **Fragment unit.** One of the discover phase's independent discoverers. See
> `discover.md` for how it is composed into the phase.

## Why one fragment covers three dialects

Terraform `azurerm_*`, Bicep, and ARM JSON all land here. Bicep compiles *to* ARM and
both key off the same `Microsoft.*` type namespace, so they share one reason to
change; all three converge on one section of one artifact; and the extraction
semantics (Azure resource type → inventory entry) are shared, with only the surface
syntax differing.

Its trigger is `{ _always: true }`, not a `_glob`. No single glob spans `.tf`,
`.bicep`, and ARM templates — ARM is plain `.json`, identifiable only by a `$schema`
containing `deploymentTemplate`. A `_when` would fail open: one misjudgment silently
drops all IaC discovery. So this fragment always runs, detects the dialects present
itself, and exits cleanly when it finds none.

## Step 1: Detect the dialects present

Record each independently — a repo may carry all three.

| Dialect     | Detection                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `terraform` | a `**/*.tf` or `**/*.tf.json` file containing a `resource "azurerm_` block                             |
| `bicep`     | a `**/*.bicep` file                                                                                    |
| `arm`       | a `**/*.json` file whose top-level `$schema` contains `deploymentTemplate`                              |

Exclude `.terraform/`, `**/node_modules/`, `**/.git/`, and anything under
`$MIGRATION_DIR` from all three scans.

**If no dialect is present:** write nothing, add no entry to
`metadata.discovery_sources`, and exit cleanly. This is a normal outcome — a startup
with no IaC is the common case, and the phase's other fragments cover it.

## Step 2: Load the extraction ref for each dialect present — and HALT if it is missing

For each detected dialect, load its ref and follow it:

| Dialect     | Ref                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `terraform` | `references/shared/extract-terraform.md`   |
| `bicep`     | `references/shared/extract-bicep.md`       |
| `arm`       | `references/shared/extract-arm.md`         |

> **HALT if a dialect is present and its ref is not on disk.** Emit `GATE_FAIL` naming
> the dialect and the missing file. Do **not** extract that dialect from your own
> knowledge of the syntax, and do not silently skip it.
>
> This guard exists because the two failure modes are otherwise indistinguishable, and
> they need opposite responses. "No dialect present" is a clean exit. "The dialect is
> present but this skill has not been taught to read it" is a bug, and improvising
> past it produces output that looks correct, satisfies every shape assertion in the
> phase's `_postconditions`, and is unreproducible — because it came from model priors
> rather than from `arm-type-canonicalization.md`. That output would be labelled
> `confidence: deterministic`, which would be a lie. A loud halt is the only honest
> behaviour.

Loading only the refs for dialects actually present is also the context-budget
mechanism: three dialects' rules loaded unconditionally would blow the phase's ~800-line
budget on their own, before the app-code, billing, RDfA, and live fragments are counted.

## Step 3: Canonicalize every type

Every extracted resource's type is translated to its canonical `Microsoft.*` ARM
string via `references/shared/arm-type-canonicalization.md`. Nothing downstream ever
sees an `azurerm_*` string.

**`azapi_resource` skips this step.** It carries the canonical ARM type in its own `type`
argument, so it is canonical on arrival — see `extract-terraform.md` § Step 2a. It is part
of the **terraform** dialect, not a fourth dialect: a `.tf` file containing only
`azapi_resource` blocks is still Terraform, still sets `source: "terraform"`, and must not
be reported as an unreadable dialect by the halt guard. Emit the spelling that file uses; the mapping tables
compare types with case FOLDED, so a mis-cased type still routes (see that file's
§ Casing is a convention, not a fact) — but `azure_id` strings are joined by exact
match, so one resource must always produce one string.

A type absent from that table is recorded in `warnings[]` as
`untranslated_terraform_type` and the resource is skipped. **Do not guess.** A guessed
type does not fail loudly — it silently fails to match every mapping table, and the
resource falls through the unknown-type policy for the wrong reason, so the report
blames the customer's estate for the skill's gap.

## Step 4: Write the contribution

Append to `azure-resource-inventory.json`'s `resources[]` and write `iac_metadata`:

```jsonc
"iac_metadata": {
  "dialects_found": ["terraform"],          // detected, not merely scanned for
  "dialects_extracted": ["terraform"],      // produced ≥1 resource
  "files_scanned": 0,
  "modules_unresolved": [],                 // registry/git modules whose content is absent
  "untranslated_types": [],
  "subscription_id_source": "unresolved"    // "unresolved" when it came from a variable or the environment
}
```

`dialects_found` and `dialects_extracted` are separate because the phase's
`_postconditions` assert per dialect: if `.tf` / `.bicep` / ARM files were **found**,
`resources[]` must contain at least one entry sourced from each dialect that was
found. "The fragment ran" proves nothing — it always runs and may exit empty.

## Step 5: Never emit a secret

App settings and connection strings contribute **names only**. Storage account keys,
Key Vault secret values, passwords, and tokens are discarded — not redacted in place,
because a redaction placeholder still discloses that the field existed and roughly how
long it was. A Key Vault *reference* is kept as a `secret_ref` edge, because the
reference is architecture and the secret is not.

Do not read `terraform.tfstate`, `*.tfstate.backup`, or any `*.tfstate` under any
circumstance. State carries resolved values the configuration only references.

**`.terraform/modules/` is the one readable path inside `.terraform/`** — it holds
downloaded module SOURCE, which is exactly as safe as a local module path and carries no
resolved values. Reading it is what stops a repo built on Azure Verified Modules from
producing a nearly empty inventory. See `extract-terraform.md` Step 3.

## Status — build step 2 (partial)

**Terraform is implemented**, via `extract-terraform.md` plus
`arm-type-canonicalization.md`. It is exercised by the `azure-iac-terraform` fixture
and its asserter.

| Lands in | What                                                              |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| step 2   | `extract-bicep.md` and `extract-arm.md`                            |

Until those two refs exist, a workspace containing `.bicep` or ARM templates **halts**
per Step 2 rather than partially discovering. That is deliberate: a partial inventory
presented as complete is worse than a stop, because the estimate that follows is
confidently wrong about the size of the estate.
