# Estimate — Pricing Mode Selection (canonical Step 0)

> Canonical pricing-mode procedure for estimate cost engines, vendored into

## Step 0a: Load the pricing cache

Read `references/vendored/pricing/aws-infra-pricing.json`. Check
`_meta.last_updated` against `_meta.staleness_days` (default 30):

- Within the window: **cached prices are the primary source.** No MCP calls
  needed for services in the file. Set `pricing_source: "cached"`.
- Past the window: infrastructure prices remain reliable. Attempt MCP (Step
  0b) for services not in the file; use cached rates as fallback with
  `pricing_source: "cached_stale"`.

Each service object carries its rates and (where relevant) a
`multi_az_handling` key. Look rates up from the file — never hardcode them.

## Step 0a-i: Check the target REGION against the cache's region

Read `_meta.region` and compare it with the design's target region. When they
differ, every rate in the file belongs to a different region than the one being
designed — commonly 5–12% low for European regions on compute and RDS.

- **MCP reachable:** reprice via MCP, **passing the target region on every
  `get_pricing` call**. A server-level `AWS_REGION` in `.mcp.json` is only that
  server's default; it does not follow the design.
- **MCP unreachable:** proceed with the cached rates, but state the mismatch
  next to every total ("rates are `<cache region>`; the target is `<target>`")
  and widen the stated accuracy band accordingly.

Never present one region's rates as another region's without saying so.

## Step 0a-ii: Check the RATE ROW, not just the service

A service can be present in the file while the specific rate row a design needs
is absent: `ec2` is there, `ec2.instances["m6i.2xlarge"]` may not be. **Service
presence is not rate availability**, and the hierarchy below keys on the row, not
the section.

Before pricing anything, resolve every concrete rate key the design requires —
each `instance_type`, `instance_class`, `node_type`, `broker_instance_type` — and
collect those with no row. A missing row then routes exactly like a missing
service: rung 2 (MCP), then rung 5.

**Never substitute a neighbouring row for a missing one** — an `m5` rate for an
`m6i` design, an `rds_postgresql` class for a DocumentDB one, a Linux rate for a
Windows-licensed instance. A near-miss rate is indistinguishable from a correct
one in the output, so the error is silent and permanent. This is the gap a
skill's sizing tables open when they are authored separately from these rates,
which is the normal case for a skill whose sizes come from source-cloud SKUs.

**A line whose rate is only PARTLY available is `"partial"`**, not `"cached"`:
its base rate resolved but a required component did not (the commonest case is
an instance priced Linux when the design says `license_model: "License
Included"`). Report the figure as a **floor**, name the missing component, and
exclude the line from any total presented as decision-grade. Rounding a partial
line up to `"cached"` hides a known understatement; rounding it down to
`"unavailable"` throws away a real number.

## Step 0b: MCP availability check (only if cache stale or service not listed)

Attempt the awspricing MCP with **up to 2 retries** (3 total attempts,
10-second timeout per attempt):

1. Attempt 1: `get_pricing_service_codes()`
2. Timeout/error → wait 1s, attempt 2
3. Timeout/error → wait 2s, attempt 3
4. All 3 fail → cached prices, `pricing_source: "cached_fallback"`

## Step 0c: Display the pricing mode

Before any calculation, surface the status:

- Cache fresh + all services covered: "Pricing source: cached (updated
  [date], ±5-10% accuracy). Live pricing API not required."
- Cache stale + MCP available: "Pricing source: live API (awspricing MCP).
  Cache is stale ([date]) — using real-time pricing."
- Cache stale + MCP unavailable: "Pricing source: stale cache only (updated
  [date]). The awspricing MCP server is unreachable. Proceeding with cached
  pricing; accuracy ±5-10% for infrastructure."
- Service or rate row not in cache + MCP unavailable: "Some services not in
  pricing cache and MCP unreachable. Those services will show
  `pricing_source: unavailable` in the estimate."
- Target region differs from `_meta.region` + MCP unavailable: "Rates are
  [cache region]; your target is [target region]. Proceeding with [cache
  region] rates — treat the totals as indicative, not regional."

## Pricing hierarchy (per-RATE-ROW lookup order)

"Found in the pricing file" below means **the concrete rate row resolved**, per
Step 0a-ii — not merely that the service's section exists.

| Priority | Source                                               | Condition                                                                                       | `pricing_source` value |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1        | `references/vendored/pricing/aws-infra-pricing.json` | Rate row found in the pricing file                                                              | `"cached"`             |
| 1b       | Same, base rate only                                 | Base row found but a required component is not priced (e.g. a Windows licence adder)            | `"partial"`            |
| 2        | MCP API (`get_pricing`)                              | Rate row NOT in the file, MCP available                                                         | `"live"`               |
| 3        | Pricing file after MCP failure                       | MCP attempted but failed, rate row IS in file                                                   | `"cached_fallback"`    |
| 4        | Formula constants / well-known published rate        | NOT in file, MCP failed, but the cost engine's own formulas carry the rate (state it verbatim)  | `"estimated"`          |
| 5        | Unavailable                                          | NOT in file, MCP failed, no formula constant either                                             | `"unavailable"`        |

Row 4 is the documented home of the `services_by_source.estimated` bucket the
shared schema and assemblers carry: a service priced from a rate the cost
engine itself states (never a guessed or remembered number) is `"estimated"`,
always accompanied by a warning naming the rate and its source. **A rate the
model recalls rather than reads is not a formula constant** — it is rung 5.

Only a line with no cache row, no MCP, AND no stated formula rate is
`"unavailable"` and excluded from totals.

Row 1b lines are excluded from any total presented as decision-grade and
reported as a floor with the missing component named, per Step 0a-ii. Track them
in `pricing_source.services_by_source.partial[]` — the shared
`estimation-infra.schema.json` does not constrain that object's keys, so this
needs no schema change.
