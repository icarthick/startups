# Migration to AWS

AI agent skills for migrating workloads to AWS, built for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview), [Codex](https://openai.com/codex), and [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/).

## What This Does

Point this plugin at your Azure subscription, GCP project, or Heroku account, your Terraform/Bicep/ARM files, application code, or billing data. It runs a structured phased assessment — discovering what you have, asking the right questions, designing the AWS architecture, estimating costs with real pricing data, and generating runnable migration artifacts.

**Supported migration sources:**

- **Azure → AWS** — App Service, AKS, Virtual Machines, Azure Functions, Azure Database for PostgreSQL/MySQL Flexible Server, Cosmos DB, Azure Cache for Redis, Blob Storage, Service Bus, Event Hubs, VNet, Azure OpenAI, and AI/agentic workloads
- **GCP → AWS** — Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, GKE, Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, VPC, and AI/agentic workloads
- **Heroku → AWS** — Dynos (→ Elastic Beanstalk by default; Fargate or EKS overrides), Postgres, Redis, Kafka, Private Spaces, Pipelines, and 13+ common add-ons

**For infrastructure migrations:**

- **Maps your GCP resources to AWS equivalents** — Cloud Run → Fargate, Cloud SQL → RDS or Aurora (based on availability requirements), GKE → EKS, Cloud Storage → S3, VPC → VPC, and more
- **Generates production-ready Terraform** — `vpc.tf`, `compute.tf`, `database.tf`, `security.tf`, `baseline.tf` with security controls (GuardDuty, CloudTrail, IMDSv2, ECR scanning), and a full `terraform/README.md`
- **Selects the right database migration tool** — pg_dump for small databases, pgcopydb for parallel copy at scale, AWS DMS for zero-downtime migrations — based on your actual database size
- **Produces numbered migration scripts** — prerequisites validation, data migration, container image migration (GCR → ECR), secrets migration (GCP Secret Manager → AWS Secrets Manager), and post-migration validation
- **Estimates monthly costs across three tiers** — Premium, Balanced, and Optimized — using real-time AWS pricing, compared against your current GCP spend

**For AI and agentic migrations:**

- **Detects your entire AI stack** — not just "you use GPT-4o" but your agents, tools, orchestration patterns, memory layers, and multi-model pipelines
- **Recommends three migration paths** for agentic workloads: retarget (keep your framework, swap models), AgentCore Harness (config-based managed agents), or Strands Agents (AWS-native multi-agent SDK)
- **Gives honest pricing comparisons** — finds the best Bedrock option for your workload with current pricing data, including side-by-side estimated monthly cost comparisons against your existing OpenAI/Gemini spend
- **Generates runnable AI artifacts** — `harness.json`, provider adapters, deployment scripts, incremental migration scripts — tailored to your specific models, tools, and architecture

**For running AI agents on AWS (agent-advisor):**

- **Recommends the right runtime** — deterministic scoring picks AgentCore, ECS/EKS, Lambda, AWS Batch, or Lambda MicroVMs for your agent, based on session duration, traffic shape, isolation, memory, and ops preferences — not a generic "use AgentCore"
- **Decomposes multi-workload systems into units** — a system of several agents, batch jobs, and services is broken into workload units, each scored independently, with a consolidation option (one platform vs best-fit-per-unit) and a whole-system architecture
- **Handles Temporal workers** — self-hosted or Temporal Cloud; worker polling tiers and Activity execution classes become units, Workflow orchestration code is never rewritten
- **Generates a layered recommendation, a migration plan, and a deployable POC** — from "which runtime" through a full plan (reusing the migration engine) to runnable proof-of-concept code and deploy scripts on the chosen runtime
- **Not a cloud migration** — this is the entry point for deciding how and where to run agents on AWS, whether you're building fresh, deploying existing code, or adding AgentCore capabilities to agents already on AWS

**Alternative (local development):** Clone this repository and symlink the plugin directory to `~/.cursor/plugins/local/migration-to-aws`, then reload Cursor.

## How to Use

After installation, just describe what you want to migrate:

**GCP migrations:**

- "Migrate my GCP infrastructure to AWS"
- "Discover my GCP project and estimate AWS costs"
- "Move my Cloud Run services to Fargate"
- "Migrate my OpenAI app to Amazon Bedrock"
- "Estimate AWS costs for my GCP workload"
- "Migrate my LangChain agents to AWS"

**Heroku migrations:**

- "Migrate my Heroku app to AWS"
- "Discover my Heroku apps and estimate AWS costs"
- "Move my Heroku Postgres to RDS"
- "Migrate from Heroku to Fargate"
- "Migrate from Heroku to Elastic Beanstalk"
- "Estimate AWS costs for my Heroku workload"
- "Migrate my Heroku Private Space to AWS"

**Running AI agents on AWS (agent-advisor):**

- "Which runtime should I use for my agent — AgentCore, ECS, EKS, or Lambda?"
- "Deploy my LangGraph agent on AWS and build a POC"
- "I have an agent idea — what should I build on AWS?"
- "Migrate my Temporal workers to AWS"
- "I'm already on AWS and want to add AgentCore memory/gateway to my agent"

Azure/GCP/Heroku migrations write a `.migration/<session>/` directory; agent-advisor writes a `.agent-advisor/<session>/` directory. Both land in the current working directory with all artifacts.

**Live Azure discovery — how it works:** No Terraform, Bicep, or exports needed. If `az login` works in your terminal, just ask — the agent confirms the target subscription and requests your consent, then inventories it using read-only `list`/`show` commands with an explicit `--subscription` on every call. It captures resource names, canonical ARM types, regions, SKUs, network topology, and app-setting **names only** — never app-setting or connection-string values, never storage account keys, never a Key Vault secret, and never an access token. It never runs a command that creates, changes, or deletes anything. If you also have Terraform, Bicep, or ARM templates, the agent cross-checks them against your live tenant and reports drift. A Resource Discovery for Azure report can be supplied instead or as well, and adds measured utilization and reservation data that turns right-sizing into a measurement rather than a guess.

**Live GCP discovery — how it works:** No Terraform or exports needed. If `gcloud auth login` works in your terminal, just ask — the agent confirms the target project and requests your consent, then inventories it using read-only list/describe commands. It captures resource names, types, regions, sizing, network topology, and env var **names only** — never env var values, secret values, database contents, or access tokens, and never a command that creates, changes, or deletes anything. If you also have Terraform, the agent cross-checks it against your live project and reports drift. (AI/agentic detection still needs your application code.)

**Live Heroku discovery — how it works:** No Terraform or exports needed. If `heroku login` works in your terminal, just ask — the agent requests your consent, then inventories your account using read-only list/info CLI commands. It captures app names, dyno types, add-on plans and prices, domains, pipelines, and config var **key names only**. It never reads config var values, credentials, or your API token, and never runs a command that creates, changes, or deletes anything. If you also have `heroku_*` Terraform, the agent cross-checks it against your live account and reports drift.

## What It Detects

### Azure → AWS

| Category      | Azure → AWS                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Compute       | App Service Plan → Elastic Beanstalk (default), Fargate or EKS override — the **plan** is the compute unit and its apps are deployments onto it           |
| Containers    | AKS → EKS, Azure Container Registry → ECR, Container Apps → Fargate                                                                                      |
| Virtual machines | VMs / VM Scale Sets → EC2 / Auto Scaling, Managed Disks → EBS (gp3, io2 above the IOPS breakpoint), MGN-based cutover                                  |
| Serverless    | Azure Functions → Lambda or Fargate (a rubric decision, not a fixed mapping — durable and long-running functions hit the Lambda ceiling)                  |
| Databases     | PostgreSQL/MySQL Flexible Server → RDS or Aurora, Cosmos DB by API (Core → DynamoDB, Mongo → DocumentDB, Cassandra → Keyspaces, Gremlin → Neptune), Azure SQL / Managed Instance → specialist-gated |
| Caching       | Azure Cache for Redis → ElastiCache                                                                                                                      |

| Networking    | VNet → VPC, NSG → Security Group, Application Gateway / Front Door → ALB + CloudFront, Azure DNS → Route 53                                              |
| Messaging     | Service Bus → SQS/SNS, Event Hubs → MSK for Kafka-protocol consumers or Kinesis for native AMQP/SDK use                                                  |
| Secrets       | Key Vault → Secrets Manager (+ KMS for keys)                                                                                                             |
| Identity      | Managed Identity → IAM Role; Entra ID → IAM Identity Center (fresh re-invite by default, federation on request)                                           |
| AI Models     | Azure OpenAI → Amazon Bedrock (same mapping as direct OpenAI — the target does not depend on which endpoint served the calls)                             |
| IaC dialects  | Terraform (`azurerm_*`), Bicep, and ARM templates                                                                                                        |

## Requirements

- Claude Code >=2.1.29, Codex (latest), or [Cursor >= 2.5](https://cursor.com/changelog/2-5)
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- At least one input source: an authenticated `gcloud` or `heroku` CLI (live discovery), Terraform files, application code, or billing data
- **For GCP infrastructure migration:** an authenticated `gcloud` CLI (recommended — live, read-only discovery with your consent, with drift detection against any Terraform found) or Terraform files / billing exports
- **For GCP AI/agentic migration:** Application source code is required (billing/IaC/live discovery alone cannot detect agent architecture)
- **For Heroku migration:** an authenticated Heroku CLI (recommended — live, read-only discovery with your consent) or Terraform files with `heroku_*` resources (Procfile/app.json supplements but cannot stand alone). When both are available, live data is authoritative for current state and Terraform drift is surfaced.
- **For agent-advisor:** `uv` (for deterministic scoring); application source code when deploying/migrating existing agents (an idea-only run needs no code)
